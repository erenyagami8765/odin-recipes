    <p>Pizza is one of the most loved dishes around the world. It starts with a soft, fluffy dough base that’s covered in rich tomato sauce and topped with gooey mozzarella cheese. From colorful veggies like capsicum and olives to spicy chicken or pepperoni, every bite offers a mix of flavors and textures that make it irresistible.</p><p>What makes pizza special is how customizable it is — you can make it cheesy, spicy, or even healthy with whole wheat dough. Baked until the crust turns golden and crispy, the aroma of melted cheese and herbs fills the air, making it a perfect meal for any occasion.</p>
