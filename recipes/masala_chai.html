    <p>Masala chai is a traditional Indian beverage that combines black tea with milk and a mix of aromatic spices. The
        flavors of ginger, cardamom, and clove blend beautifully to create a warm, soothing drink that instantly
        refreshes your senses. It’s often enjoyed in the morning or evening with biscuits or snacks.</p>
